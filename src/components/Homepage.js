        A mathemagician is a mathematician who is also a magician. The term
        mathemagic is believed to have been introduced by Royal Vale Heath with
        his 1933 book Mathemagic. The name mathemagician was probably first
        applied to Martin Gardner, but has since been used to describe many
        mathematician/magicians, including Arthur T. Benjamin, Persi Diaconis,
        and Colm Mulcahy. Diaconis has suggested that the reason so many
        mathematicians are magicians is that inventing a magic trick and
        inventing a theorem are very similar activities. Mathemagician is a
        neologism, specifically a portmanteau, that combines mathematician and
        magician. A great number of self-working mentalism tricks rely on
        mathematical principles. Max Maven often utilizes this type of magic in
        his performance. The Mathemagician is the name of a character in the
        1961 children`s book The Phantom Tollbooth. He is the ruler of
        Digitopolis, the kingdom of mathematics.
